# labs_Visual-Paradigm
Visual Paradigm Labs. Tasks conditions are in PDF files.<br/>
The laboratory works are based on the example of using an ATM. The course of the ATM operation process, as well as its interaction with systems, was, in large part, redesigned for a modern mativ, rather than in initial tasks.<br/>
In these laboratory works, the following models were considered:<br/>
1. Use Case Diagrams;<br/>
2. Use Case Scenarios;<br/>
3. Class Diagrams;<br/>
4. Collaboration Diagrams;<br/>
5. Sequence Diagrams;<br/>
6. Activity Diagrams.
